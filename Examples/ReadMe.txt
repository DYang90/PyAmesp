Examples
--------
Ex1.
   The structure of cyclohexene will be optimized by using BFGSLineSearch
   optimizer implemented in ASE.

Ex2.
   The structures of 1,3-Butadiene and Ethylene will be optimized by using
   GDIIS optimizer implemented in Gaussian.

Ex3.
   The transition path of Diels-Alder reaction will be searched by CI-NEB
   method with LBFGS optimizer implemented in ASE.

Ex4.
   The transition path of Diels-Alder reaction will be searched by CI-NEB
   method with LBFGS optimizer implemented in ASE (fmax <= 0.5 eV/Ang).
   Then, the dimer method will be utilized to refine the structure of the
   transition state.
